SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE

WHY AMAVASYA IS IMPORTANT:

**For Ancestor Worship**:
- Pitrus (ancestors) are believed to be closest on Amavasya
- Offerings reach them directly
- Blessings from satisfied ancestors
- Removal of Pitru Dosha (ancestral afflictions)

**For Spiritual Growth**:
- Darkness symbolizes ignorance to be overcome
- Introspection and self-reflection
- Meditation is more powerful
- Karmic cleansing

**For Material Life**:
- Blessings from ancestors bring prosperity
- Family harmony
- Resolution of ancestral karma
- Protection from obstacles

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DIFFERENCE: AMAVASYA VS PURNIMA

AMAVASYA (New Moon):
- Dark night (no moon visible)
- End of Krishna Paksha (dark fortnight)
- Ancestor worship primary focus
- Introspective, solemn observance
- Generally avoid new beginnings

PURNIMA (Full Moon):
- Bright night (full moon visible)
- End of Shukla Paksha (bright fortnight)
- Deity worship primary focus
- Celebratory, festive observance
- Auspicious for new beginnings

EXCEPTION - DIWALI AMAVASYA:
The only Amavasya that is festive and celebratory, focusing on Lakshmi worship rather than ancestor worship.
